# Titanic

In this project, I have attempted to predict the survival of passengers in Titanic based on the passenger attributes mentioned in the 
dataset like Age, Gender, Number of Siblings onboard, Fare etc. I have used two machine learning models to predict which passengers were 
likely to survive the sinking and which were not.

1. XgBoost
2. Random Forest
